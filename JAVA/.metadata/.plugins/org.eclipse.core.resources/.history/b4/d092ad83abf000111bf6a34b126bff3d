	<h1>Wei's Homepage for 4221</h1>
	<p>I am trying to write a paragraph about myself:</p>
	<p>I dare not to use a photo. Because...well...you know</p>
	<img src="demo.jpg" />
	<p>I am not that fat, although I love those food:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Chocolate</li>
		<li>Ice Cream</li>
		<li>Fried Chicken</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Well, getting fatter and fatter...I deserve it. T^T</p>

	<p>I really don't know how can I put a table in my web page.</p>
	<p>I try to list my merits and demerits.</p>
	<table border="0">
		<tr>
			<th>Merits</th>
			<th>Demerits</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Warm hearted</td>
			<td>Hard Working</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Lazy</td>
			<td>hate to exercise</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p></p>
	<a href="http://www.osu.edu/">Visit My School</a>
	<p>
		Then I have implement all the required things:<br /> at least one
		heading, at least one paragraph, at least one image (e.g., a picture
		of yourself), at least one ordered or unordered list, at least one
		table (e.g., information about yourself that you are willing to share
		publicly), and at least one hyperlink to an external page.
	</p>
